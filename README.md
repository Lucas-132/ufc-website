# Ufc Web Home Page
## Summary
Here is a small mma themed Web HomePage project that doesn't use any framework or library, just pure vanilla HTML/CSS and also a bit of Javascript.

## Specificity
This web page was made from scratch by using a reset.css file, I made this because I wanted to know what it would be like to create a stylesheet starting from 0.

## What I trained making this project 🧠
- CSS layout and positioning
- CSS selectors and states : pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, applying styles conditionally via modifier classes
- CSS Transitions & Animation basics : smooth UI changes and animating tansforms (dropdown arrows)
- Interactive UI Techniques (dropdown)
- Component-Driven UI Thinking : Implementing a dropdown component pattern / shop cards component pattern

## Side note
I am no longer developping this web page. The main reason being that I'm currently prioritizing other projects. I made this one for fun but some features are clearly missing
